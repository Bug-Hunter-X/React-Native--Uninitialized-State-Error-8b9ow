# React Native: Uninitialized State Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access state before it has been initialized. This typically happens in functional components before the first render or in class components before `componentDidMount` completes.

## Bug Description
Accessing a state variable before initialization leads to undefined behavior and potential crashes.  The example shows how this can occur and how to resolve it.

## Solution
The solution involves employing conditional rendering or using the `useEffect` hook (for functional components) or checking for `this.state` (for class components) before accessing the state variable.  This ensures that the component only accesses the state variable after it has been properly initialized.
